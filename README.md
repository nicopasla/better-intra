## Features

> ☁️ *marked features require cloud sync / 42 sign-in.*

### 📅 Logtime

Replaces the default logtime view with a monthly calendar showing your logged hours at a glance.

* **Monthly calendar** — each month shows your hours as a colour-coded grid. Darker means more hours per day. See weekly totals on the right.
* **Scroll through months** — click and drag, or use your mouse wheel.
* **Goal tracking** — set a target (default 140h/month). See a progress bar, your percentage, and remaining hours on hover.
* **Daily average** — average hours per active day.
* **Last active label** — shows when you were last seen. Choose between a date, "2 days ago", or both.
* **Emoji mode** — pick an emoji and set how much it's "worth". Track your earnings with a monthly cap.
* **Custom colours** — pick your own accent colour for the calendar and labels.
* **Calendar events overlay** — synced 42 events appear as markers on your logtime calendar days.

---

### 🖥️ Clusters

* **Directional markers** — small arrows on the cluster map showing which way each seat faces. Works for **Belgium** clusters (shi, fu, mi, a1, a2). Toggle on/off from the cluster tab bar.
* **Cluster picker** — a dropdown on the cluster tab bar to quickly switch clusters, with a markers on/off button.
* **Default cluster** — set your preferred cluster and it loads automatically when you open the page.
* **Open in new tab** — optionally open user profiles in a new tab when clicking seats on the cluster map.

---

### 🗺️ Cluster Map Dialog

A live interactive cluster map popup accessible from profile quick-link buttons.

* **Real-time seat occupancy** — see user avatars overlaid on occupied seats with login tooltips. Polls every 30 seconds with a "Updated X min ago" indicator.
* **Cluster room tabs** — switch between cluster rooms within the dialog.
* **Wi-Fi users list** — a dedicated tab showing who's currently connected via Wi-Fi, with avatars, logins, and connection time.
* **Click to visit profile** — click any occupied seat to open that user's profile, optionally in a new tab.
* **In-dialog settings** — toggle directional markers and set your default cluster from within the dialog.

### 👤 Profile

* **Custom visuals** — set your own avatar, banner, and background images with mode options (fill, fit, stretch, center, tile). **Click your avatar** on your profile page to open the customisation panel with zoom slider (50–200%), click-and-drag repositioning, and mouse wheel zoom on the preview. See a live preview as you type the image URL.
* **Avatar decoration** — toggle a transparent or solid-colour background behind your avatar with a colour picker. Add an optional solid border around your avatar.

* **Instant profile visuals** — custom avatars, banners, and backgrounds are cached locally. After the first visit they appear instantly on any profile. Changes refresh silently in the background.
* **Dashboard cards** — reorder your profile cards (Logtime, Agenda, Evaluations, Projects, Achievements) by dragging them. Hide cards you don't need.

* **Achievement milestones** — completed achievements get a subtle animated glow.
* **Full achievements list** — replaces the native "Last Achievements" card with a scrollable list of all achievements.
* **Completed projects (marks)** — the Projects card lists all your graded projects with dates and scores. Multi-attempt projects expand to show each attempt. Sort by newest or oldest first. Projects flagged "Outstanding" during evaluation get a ⭐ next to their name — visible on any user's profile. ☁️

* **Thursday Roulette** — a dashboard card showing the current profile's roulette win history, total points, and a live countdown to the next Thursday 8:00 draw. Works on any user's profile. ☁️
* **Evaluation stats** — the Thursday Roulette card also shows your monthly evaluation history as a corrector: total evaluations, failures, and success percentage. ☁️
* **Moulinette robot icons** — on project corrected pages, the default moulinette image is replaced with a robot icon (normal for passed, broken for failed).
* **Info card badges** — wallet, level, rank, score, and seat shown as coloured badges below the profile header. Can be hidden in settings.
* **Wallet shop link** — clicking the wallet badge opens the 42 shop in a new tab.

## Privacy

See the full [Privacy Policy](./PRIVACY.md).

- All settings are stored locally via `chrome.storage.local`. Nothing is sent anywhere unless you explicitly enable cloud sync.
- **Cloud sync** (optional): your settings are stored in a Cloudflare Worker KV under a hash of your login, so they can be synced across devices. The worker retains invocation logs for debugging (not used for tracking).
- **Friends widget** (optional, requires cloud sync): friend logins are stored locally and also included in your synced settings in KV. The worker additionally caches friend user IDs and online status in KV to reduce 42 API calls.
- **Logtime data** is read from the intra page directly — it never leaves your browser.
- **Other users' profiles**: when visiting another user's profile, their public custom visuals (avatar, banner, background) are fetched from the Cloudflare Worker if they use Better Intra. No data is sent to third parties.
- Permissions requested: `storage` (save settings), `activeTab` (interact with 42 Intra pages), and access to the extension's Cloudflare Worker for optional sync features. No analytics, tracking, or advertising.
